Business Idea: 1) “Pop-in”: A Boutique for International Travellers 2) Targeted Ethnic Group: People from the Philippines

Analysis: As a big retail firm, seeking to create a business idea tailored to an ethnic group, the Philippines is a clear choice. The data shows that the Philippines is by far the most populous of the listed countries of origin in the trade area, making up 0.02% of the Canadian Permanent Resident population, but 0.13% of the Temporary Resident population. Philippines nationals also account for the fifth highest numerical count of Permanent Residents, with 190. However, the striking statistic that makes the Philippines stand out is the Maritime Provinces Count Percentage Penetration (NC23Q1PRCPHL) of 2.81 — the highest percentage penetration number by far among any of the countries listed.
Indian immigrants make up the most numerous count of Permanent Residents (1654) but rank much lower (2.56%, the third lowest percentage penetration) in terms of their relative representation in the Permanent Resident population. On the other hand, French nationals make up the lowest numerical count of Permanent Residents (37) but the third highest percentage penetration (3.5%). China, People’s Republic of, United States of America, and Pakistan rank higher in terms of Permanent Resident numerical count, but much lower in terms of Permanent Resident percentage penetration.

By using external market research, we can gain a greater understanding of why the Filipino population is so attractive. Canada is home to the third largest Filipino diaspora in the world, according to a UBC article published in January of 2017. As of the 2016 census, more than 817,000 Canadians belong to the Filipino diaspora. Moreover, Filipino Canadians have displayed an increased tendency to prioritize convenience, and willing to travel further in order to find what they want. The word-of-mouth among the Filipino community is said to be especially strong, meaning businesses with especially strong reputations for service and quality have been able to easily capture a growing Filipino customer base. As a largely family-centric community, Filipino customers also tend to bring their children and extended family members with them when shopping.

Implementation Plan: Q2: Research and begin to plan concept. Look into business feasibility, market research, and pricing strategy. Identify potential source and supplier of goods, including any necessary permits/approvals to open a business.

Business Idea: 1) The Philippine Villa: Authentic Filipino Cuisine 2) Philippines

Based off the given data in the table, there is a high percentage of permanent and temporary residents from the Philippines already located in the Hamilton, ON Trade Area. A total of 190 permanent residents with 2.81% Pen, and a total of 1103 temporary residents with 3.85% Pen. These figures, combined with the overall population of Philippines origin living in Canada, demonstrate the untapped consumer market that is available and ripe for growth.
In terms of external research, studies demonstrate that Philippine cuisine is one of the fastest growing food trends and is taking over North American cities. Particularly, Toronto features over 400 Filipino eateries and bakeries, and for good reason.
